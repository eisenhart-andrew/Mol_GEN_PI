Molecular generation using MOL-DQN env judged by persistance image trained RFR


This repository contains the code for combining the persitance image trained model from 
Townsend, J., Micucci, C. P., Hymel, J. H., Maroulas, V., & Vogiatzis, K. D. (2020). Nature communications, 11(1), 1-9.

with the molecular generation framework created by google MOL_DQN original paper here:
Zhou, Z., Kearnes, S., Li, L., Zare, R. N., & Riley, P. (2019). Scientific reports, 9(1), 1-10.

The main generation files are contained in mol_dqn/chemgraph/, with the current python files for naive molecular generation being optimize_CO2.py, and results from the most recent test stored in the secondcorr_opt_naive directory.
